#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)0(n), as the value of n increases the number of iterations thorugh the loop increases at the same rate, linear.

b) we have a for loop and a while loop, which are 0(n), the while loop is nested and has j _= 2, because of the nested loop and the _ of j, i think it's 0(n^2)

c) the recursive function is called once and runs until it hits it's base case 0{n)

## Exercise II

I would divide the number of floors in half to find a midpoint, start testing there and then move up or down depending on whether the egg broke, this feels like linear - 0(n)

# and we begin!!
